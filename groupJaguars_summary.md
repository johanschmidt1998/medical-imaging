Medical imaging report

Introduction
As part of our first project in data science we have been provided with medical images containing skin lesions. The purpose of this report is to give a brief overview of the content of the images by examining what diagnoses are present in the photos, investigating what data is available, and the quality of the content.

Data overview
As part of the project our group has been provided with part of the public data set PAD-UFES-20. Our part of the data set contains 127 images each containing an image skin with a lesion on it. The images are in PNG format and ranges anywhere from 85 kilobytes to 10 megabytes. The photos are taken up close and some of them contain a circle or an arrow drawn on the skin to indicate where the lesion is present.

Types of diagnosis
Through thorough examination we have come to discover a range of diagnosis present in the images. Despite limited medical knowledge we have tried to go through the photos and compare them to different images found in medical journals on google scholar and dermnetnz. Below are our own images, and underneath them contain a description of our suggestion as to what the diagnosis of the image may be.

This lesion appears to be a raised nodule with a mix of pigmentation, including pink and darker areas that may suggest melanocytic activity.

This lesion shows a lesion with an irregular border and colors ranging from red to purple with crusting. A diagnosis could be psoriasis or eczema.

Source: Dermnet	This appears to be a well-demarcated, pigmented lesion with an irregular outline that could be suggestive of a nevus.

These images of lesion and their descriptions highlights a few of our findings among a longer list of possible diagnosis in the dataset we have been provided with including melanocytic, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Basal cell carcinoma, psoriasis, eczema, and dermatofibroma. 

Observations and conclusion
After inspecting the images we have annotated them by coloring the lesion in label studio. Some of the images contained lesions that were difficult to annotate which made us skip them and focus on the ones where the lesions were clear and easy to annotate. However, this still resulted in over 100 images of lesion.
