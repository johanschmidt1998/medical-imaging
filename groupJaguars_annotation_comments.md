PAT_1034_160_819.png	- Nothing about the image indicates precicely where the lesion is

PAT_1402_1376_507.png -  Similar to the last image, and includes some scaring around the focal point
j
PAT_1412_1421_512.png - Discolouration but this seems to be apparent throughout the entire image, not just the center of the image, so it isn't obvious what part of the image is referrenced 

PAT_1452_1564_377.png - No clear sign of anything that would be considered dangerous or cancerous
