PAT_15_3138_959.png - This particular image contained a few brighter spots but it was unclear exactly what had to be marked.

PAT_377_1580_429.png - This image contained quite a bit of redness and it was not quite clear exactly what had to be annotated.

PAT_566_179_23.png - It was quite ambiguous what the leison was in this image.

PAT_67_104_695 - Image contains dark spot with holes - easy to annotate

PAT_282_433_934 - Image contains a lesion with red and light spots. The lesion is marked which made it easy to spot.

PAT_282_433_934- This image displays a lesion that is sutured, surrounded by markings that are likely surgical pen markings.

The annotation process went reasonably well. We found a few of the photos challenging to deal with due to a variety of reasons listed below.

PAT_1034_160_819.png	- Nothing about the image indicates precicely where the lesion is

PAT_1402_1376_507.png -  Similar to the last image, and includes some scaring around the focal point

PAT_1412_1421_512.png - Discolouration but this seems to be apparent throughout the entire image, not just the center of the image, so it isn't obvious what part of the image is referrenced 

PAT_1452_1564_377.png - No clear sign of anything that would be considered dangerous or cancerous

PAT_1468_1622_219.png - This image has a lot of irritation on the skin which makes it hard to identify which parts can be considered lesion

PAT_1536_1819_91.png - Practically no lesion in this image, just light scaring at a very small point. Image is also extremely small and therefore the quality is sub-optimal

PAT_1569_2456_393.png - This image contains a lot of wrinkles which makes is impacting the shape and size of the lesion, making it hard to identify. Along with this there are a lot of changes and inconsistencies with the colour.

PAT_1729_3235_712.png - Unapparent what spot in this image is lesion rather than dry skin.

PAT_1739_3261_325.png - Very light lesion and is coloured almost the same as the skin colour, making it hard to identify and mask.

PAT_2024_4224_141.png - Lesion appears to be dominating the image, making it particularly hard to identify which parts are unaffected.

PAT_2153_4782_321.png - Once again, lesion is coloured almost the same as the skin colour, making it hard to identify and mask.
